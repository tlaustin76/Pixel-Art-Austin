# Pixel-Art-Austin
final project Udacity



This Project is to allow Users to create
Pixel Art by selecting the height and width of the grid Canvas
and choosing colors to paint a picture. 

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this project. 

Also used JQUERY to shorten the code by linking  jquery CDN to my JS file
